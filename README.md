# Pygame geometry dash level solver using NIC
 
_Code by Danil Davydov, Ilia Mitrokhin, Erokhin Evgenii_


## Overview
Among video games, Geometry Dash stands out as a comprehensive challenge that requires precise timing, coordination, and adaptability to navigate through various levels filled with different types of obstacles. AI should determine the type of obstacle to be able to recognize if this obstacle is friendly or not. Traditional methods for solving such games often rely on handcrafted algorithms or human-designed strategies, which may not be optimal for handling the complexity and variability of game environments. In this project, we explore the application of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), a nature-inspired computing approach, to train artificial neural networks capable of playing Geometry Dash.

## Level information
Currently, there are 3 levels. You can choose one as an index at the begining of simulation
