# Pygame geometry dash level solver using NIC
 
_Code by Danil Davydov, Ilia Mitrokhin, Erokhin Evgenii_


## Overview
In this project, we explore the application of NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), 
a nature-inspired computing approach, to train artificial neural networks capable of playing Geometry Dash.
